# Computer-Use Agents SOTA Challenge: Hack the North + Global Online

*Published on August 25, 2025 by Francesco Bonacci*

We’re bringing something new to [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com), Canada’s largest hackathon, this year: a head-to-head competition for **Computer-Use Agents** - on-site at Waterloo and a **Global online challenge**. From September 12–14, 2025, teams build on the **Cua Agent Framework** and are scored in **HUD’s OSWorld-Verified** environment to push past today’s SOTA on [OS-World](https://os-world.github.io).

## Track A: On-site @ Hack the North

There’s one global leaderboard: **Cua - Best State-of-the-Art Computer-Use Agent**. Use any model setup you like (cloud or local). After projects are submitted, [HUD](https://www.hud.so) runs the official benchmark; the top team earns a **guaranteed YC partner interview (W26 batch)**. We’ll also feature winners on our blog and socials and kit the team out with swag.

## Track B: Cua Global Online Hackathon

**Cua** and [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com) organize a global hackathon to find the **most creative uses of local and hybrid computer-use agents**. There are no geographic restrictions on who can join — this is a worldwide competition focused on **originality, impact, and inventive applications** that showcase what's possible with local and hybrid inference.

**Prizes:** 
- 1st **MacBook Air M4 (or equivalent value)** + features in Cua & Ollama channels
- 2nd **$500 CAD + swag**
- 3rd **swag + public feature**

## How it works

Two different tracks, two different processes:

### On-site (Track A)
Build during the weekend and submit a repo with a one-line start command. **HUD** executes your command in a clean environment and runs **OSWorld-Verified**. Scores come from official benchmark results; ties break by median, then wall-clock time, then earliest submission. Any model setup is allowed (cloud or local).

**HUD** runs official evaluations immediately after submission. Winners are announced at the **closing ceremony**.

### Rules
- Fork and star the [Cua repo](https://github.com/trycua/cua).
- Add your agent and instructions in `samples/community/hack-the-north/<YOUR_TEAM_NAME>`.
- Include a README with details on the approach and any required notes.  
- Submit a PR.  

**Deadline: Sept 15, 8:00 AM EDT**

### Global Online (Track B)
Open to anyone, anywhere. Build on your own timeline and submit through the **Cua Discord form** by the deadline.

**Project Requirements:**
- Your agent must integrate **Cua and Ollama** in some way
- Your agent must be **easily runnable by judges**

Judged by **Cua** and **Ollama** teams on:  
- **Creativity (30%)** – originality, usefulness, surprise factor  
- **Technical Depth (30%)** – quality of engineering and agent design  
- **Use of Ollama (30%)** – effective integration of local/hybrid inference  
- **Polish (10%)** – presentation, clarity, demo readiness  

### Submission Process
Submissions will be collected via a **form link provided in the Cua Discord**. Your submission must contain:

- **GitHub repo** containing the agent source code and a clear README with instructions on how to use the agent
- **Explanation** of the models and tools used, and what's local or hybrid about your design  
- **Short demo video** (up to two minutes)

A **commit freeze** will be used to ensure that no changes are made after the deadline. Winners will be announced after judging is complete.

**Deadline: Sept 28, 11:59 PM UTC (extended due to popular demand!)**
